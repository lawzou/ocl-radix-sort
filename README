2) Short description

The algorithm is the radix sort algorithm
Marcho Zagha and Guy E. Blelloch. “Radix Sort For Vector Multiprocessor.”
in: Conference on High Performance Networking and Computing, pp. 712-721, 1991.

Each integer is made of _TOTALBITS bits. The radix is made of _BITS bits. The sort is made of
several passes, each consisting in sorting against a group of bits corresponding to the radix.
_TOTALBITS/_BITS passes are needed.


3) Installing

The software is made of a C++ class and a exemple given in CLRadixSortMain.cpp
No library needed but a working OpenCL library and g++ 

The sorting parameters can be changed in "CLRadixSortParam.hpp"

compilation for Mac:
g++ CLRadixSort.cpp CLRadixSortMain.cpp -framework opencl -Wall

compilation for Linux:
g++ CLRadixSort.cpp CLRadixSortMain.cpp -lOpenCL -Wall

Tested (may 2011) on Mac, Linux with AMD GPU/CPU and NVIDIA GPU.

Not tested on Intel under Windows.
