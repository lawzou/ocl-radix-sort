2) Short description

The algorithm is the radix sort algorithm
Marcho Zagha and Guy E. Blelloch. “Radix Sort For Vector Multiprocessor.”
Conference on High Performance Networking and Computing, pp. 712-721, 1991.

The pdf can be found by Google.

Each integer is made of _TOTALBITS bits. The radix is made of _BITS bits. The sort is made of
several passes, each consisting in sorting against a group of bits corresponding to the radix.
_TOTALBITS/_BITS passes are needed.


3) Installing

The software is made of a C++ class and an example, given in "CLRadixSortMain.cpp".
No library needed (but a working OpenCL installation and g++)

The sorting parameters can be changed in "CLRadixSortParam.hpp". It is possible to change the size of the integers,
the size of the radix, the maximal size of the list, and the distribution of the 
work-groups and work-items on the device for obtaining optimal speed and/or avoid 
overflow of the device shared memory.

compilation for Mac:
g++ CLRadixSort.cpp CLRadixSortMain.cpp -framework opencl

compilation for Linux:
g++ CLRadixSort.cpp CLRadixSortMain.cpp -lOpenCL

Tested (may 2011) on Mac, Linux with AMD GPU/CPU and NVIDIA GPU.

Not tested on Intel under Windows.
